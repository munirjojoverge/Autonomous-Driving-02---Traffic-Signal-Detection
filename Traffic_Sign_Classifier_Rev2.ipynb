    "**1. First attempt: building a minimum viable model and debugging**\n",
    "- I wanted to get a working model first. I started with a basic multilayer perceptron which I adapted from `TensorFlow-Examples`. I trained it for 15 epochs, which had an accuracy of 6% on the training and test sets. I then trained a two-layer convolutional neural network for 15 epochs which had an accuracy of 5-6% on the training and test sets. \n",
    "    - The accuracy was lower than I expected and the cost seemed high (of order 10^6 in the first epoch, 10^5 in the second and third and in the hundreds in the tenth epoch), so I adjusted parameters hoping to improve it before training for longer.\n",
    "    - The cost reduced significantly (to single digits by the second epoch as opposed to order 10^5) after I added a small positive bias to the initial weights and biases. Strangely, the accuracy did not increase, but remained at 5-6%. The cost did not decrease significantly over the next 10 epochs either.\n",
    "    - I went on Slack to see what results people were getting to get a feel for how wrong I was. I saw that people often trained their networks for hundreds of epochs so I thought it would be good to train my network for e.g. 100 epochs.\n",
    "- I rewrote the multilayer perceptron in a Python Script and it worked fine, returning an accuracy of over 70% accuracy within 2 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Improvements to the model**\n",
    "- I then added a convolution layer before the two fully connected layers and the output layer.\n",
    "- This new model produced a validation accuracy of above 90% after 15 epochs (parameters not tuned), which was higher than that for the two-layer feedforward network. So I chose this model with a convolution layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3. Tuning Parameters**\n",
